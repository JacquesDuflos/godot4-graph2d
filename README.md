# Graph2D add-on for Godot 4.x

**Graph 2D is an addon able to display plots in your user interface in a very simple way**.

This repository contains the add-on and examples.

## Fork

This fork is made to add the option of choosing freely the min and max of the axis.
A boolean export value, named "rounded_number_of_steps_x", will be added to the graph object for each axis. If set to
true, the behaviour will stay the same as the main add-on, except for it will print to the consol an explanation.
If set to false, the min and max of the axix will be such as specified by the user.
By default, this value will be set to true for the y axis, and to false for the x axis as it is commun to put the
real-time as x axis.

An example will be added where the x axis represent the las 5 seconds, and the y axis represent the value of a slider.

## Features

- Display several plots on the same graph.
- Supports curve thickness and color.
- Customizable chart axes (axis label and grid).
- Real-time plotting.
- Works with all renderers.
- Works on desktop platforms and HTML5 (others target were not tested).
- Documentation included with the plugin.

## Usage

### Single plot
- Add a `Graph2D` node as a child of the root node. Adapt its size to the control.

- Create a new plot using the method `Graph2D.add_plot_item()` from your script. The arguments are in order the name of the plot, its color and finally the thickness of the line.
    - Note: This method will return an `Graph2D.PlotItem` object which will then be used to reference the plot and update its points.

```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
	var my_plot: Graph2D.PlotItem = $Graph2D.add_plot_item("My Plot", Color.GREEN, 1.0)
```
- Add point with `Graph2D.PlotItem.add_point(Vector coord)` method.

```gdscript
for x in range(0, 11, 1):
	var y = randf_range(0, 1)
	my_plot.add_point(Vector2(x, y))
```

### Multiple plots in graph

You can add multiple curves to the graph.

### Miscellaneous

The graphic can be customized with several properties.

You can view on the top right of the graphic the coordinates of the plot pointed by the mouse cursor.
